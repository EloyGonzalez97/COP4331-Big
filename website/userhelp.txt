						* How to use User class *
						*************************

Create a new user (Signs in automatically after account creation):
	$user = User::withSignUp($username, $email, $firstname, $lastname, $password);


Sign in user:
	$user = User::withLogin($username, $password);


Logout user:
	$user->logout();


Check security level:
	$level = $user->checkSecLevel();


Get user ID:
	$ID = $user->getID();

For each page that is NOT the homepage, we need to check to see if a session exists. Snippet needed:
	if(session_id() == '' || !isset($_SESSION)) {
		// return to the homepage of app/website
	}
	
*THIS IS GOING TO BE UPDATED SO YOU DONT HAVE TO CHECK EACH TIME*
